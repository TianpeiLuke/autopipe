# Pipeline Catalog Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the project plan for implementing the Pipeline Catalog module as described in the [Pipeline Catalog Design](../1_design/pipeline_catalog_design.md) document. The implementation will convert the existing examples folder into a structured, discoverable catalog of pipeline templates that users can easily browse, search, and adapt for their specific needs.

## Project Objectives

1. Create a well-organized catalog of pipeline templates
2. Improve discoverability of available pipelines
3. Make pipeline selection intuitive for users
4. Include the catalog as a standard part of the Cursus package
5. Provide CLI tools for interacting with the catalog

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Structure (Week 1)

1. **Create Base Directory Structure**
   - [x] Create `src/cursus/pipeline_catalog/` directory
   - [x] Create subdirectories for frameworks and tasks
   - [x] Add necessary `__init__.py` files for proper package structure
   - [x] Set up basic README.md template

2. **Develop Basic Indexing System**
   - [x] Define schema for index.json
   - [x] Create initial empty index.json file
   - [x] Implement index loading utilities

3. **Set Up Testing Framework**
   - [x] Create test directory structure for pipeline catalog

   - [x] Update import statements and references
   - [x] Ensure proper documentation in each file

2. **Migrate PyTorch Pipelines**
   - [x] Refactor and move PyTorch training pipeline
   - [x] Refactor and move PyTorch end-to-end pipeline
   - [x] Refactor and move PyTorch model registration pipeline (included in end-to-end)
   - [x] Update import statements and references
   - [x] Ensure proper documentation in each file

3. **Migrate Other Pipelines**
   - [x] Refactor and move Cradle data loading pipeline
   - [x] Refactor and move dummy training pipeline (covered by task-based references)
   - [x] Update import statements and references

4. **Create Task-Based Symlinks**
   - [x] Set up symlinks in the tasks directory for training pipelines
   - [x] Set up symlinks for evaluation pipelines
   - [x] Set up symlinks for registration pipelines
   - [x] Set up symlinks for data processing pipelines

5. **Complete Documentation**
   - [x] Write detailed docstrings for all pipeline modules
   - [x] Create usage examples for each pipeline
   - [x] Populate the main README.md with comprehensive guidance

**Deliverables:**
- ✓ All pipeline files migrated to new structure
- ✓ Task-based symlinks established
- ✓ Complete documentation for all pipeline modules
- ✓ Populated README.md with navigation and usage information

### Phase 3: CLI Tool Development (Week 4)

1. **Implement Core CLI Functionality**
   - [x] Create `catalog_cli.py` module in `src/cursus/cli/`
   - [x] Implement list command to show all pipelines
   - [x] Implement search command with filtering options
   - [x] Implement show command to display pipeline details
   - [x] Implement generate command to create pipeline templates

2. **Build Index Generation Tools**
   - [x] Create tools to scan pipeline directory
   - [x] Extract metadata from pipeline files
   - [x] Generate and update index.json automatically
   - [x] Add validation for index contents

3. **Add CLI Documentation**
   - [x] Create help text for all commands
   - [x] Add examples for common use cases
   - [x] Document all command options
   - [ ] Create man pages or equivalent documentation

4. **Clean Up Legacy Code**
   - [x] Remove redundant examples directory
   - [x] Update documentation references

**Deliverables:**
- ✓ Fully functional CLI tool
- ✓ Automatic index generation
- ✓ Comprehensive CLI documentation (excluding man pages)


### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 5)

1. **Integrate with Package**
   - [ ] Update package setup.py to include pipeline_catalog
   - [ ] Configure entry points for CLI commands
   - [ ] Update import statements throughout codebase
   - [ ] Ensure catalog is included in package installations

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - [ ] Unit tests for all components
   - [ ] Integration tests for pipeline imports
   - [ ] CLI functionality tests
   - [ ] End-to-end tests with package installation

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - [ ] Create test scenarios for different user types
   - [ ] Conduct usability testing with internal users
   - [ ] Collect and address feedback
   - [ ] Refine based on user experience

**Deliverables:**
- Fully integrated catalog within package
- Complete test coverage
- Usability validation

### Phase 5: Documentation and Release (Week 6)

## Resource Requirements

1. **Personnel**
   - 1 Senior Python developer (Full-time, 6 weeks)
   - 1 Technical writer (Part-time, 2 weeks)
   - 1 QA engineer (Part-time, 1 week)

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Development environment with all frameworks (XGBoost, PyTorch)
   - Test environment for package installation testing
   - Documentation build system

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Breaking changes to existing code | High | Medium | Comprehensive testing before release; maintain backward compatibility where possible |
| Incomplete documentation | Medium | Medium | Allocate dedicated time for documentation; include documentation in definition of done |
| Discovery tools not intuitive | Medium | Low | Early user testing; iterate on CLI interface based on feedback |
| Import errors after refactoring | High | Medium | Thorough testing of all import paths; create comprehensive test suite |
| Symlink issues on different OSes | Medium | Low | Test on multiple operating systems; provide alternatives to symlinks if needed |

## Success Criteria

1. All existing pipeline examples successfully migrated to new structure
2. CLI tools provide intuitive access to pipeline catalog
3. Users can find appropriate pipelines through multiple navigation paths
4. Full test coverage for all components
5. Complete documentation integrated with main package docs
6. No regression in existing functionality

## Conclusion

The implementation of the Pipeline Catalog will significantly improve the discoverability and usability of pipeline templates within the Cursus package. By following this structured plan, we can ensure a smooth transition from the current examples folder to a comprehensive, organized catalog that serves as both documentation and a practical tool for users.

## Next Steps

2. ✓ Phase 2: Pipeline Migration and Documentation - COMPLETE
3. ✓ Phase 3: CLI Tool Development - COMPLETE
4. Begin Phase 4: Integration and Testing
