# Alignment Validation Visualization Integration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to integrate visualization capabilities from the step builder testing framework into the alignment validation reporting system. The goal is to enhance alignment validation reports with visual charts, scoring systems, and improved presentation similar to the successful builder test reports.

## Current State Analysis

### Builder Reporter Capabilities (Source System)

The builder reporter system (`src/cursus/validation/builders/`) provides:

1. **Comprehensive Scoring System**
   - Weighted scoring across 4 test levels (Level 1-4)
   - Quality ratings (Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Needs Work, Poor)
   - Test importance weighting for nuanced evaluation
   - Overall score calculation with level-specific weights

2. **Visual Chart Generation**
   - Matplotlib-based bar charts showing scores by level
   - Color-coded performance indicators (green=excellent, red=poor)
   - Overall score line overlay for context
   - Professional styling with grids, labels, and percentage annotations

3. **Report Structure**
   - JSON reports with detailed scoring breakdowns
   - PNG chart files for visual representation
   - Organized output in `scoring_reports/` directories
   - Metadata integration for comprehensive reporting

4. **Integration Points**
   - `StepBuilderScorer` class for score calculation
   - `generate_chart()` method for visualization creation
