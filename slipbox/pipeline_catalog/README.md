# Pipeline Catalog Documentation

## Overview

The Pipeline Catalog is a Zettelkasten-inspired pipeline organization system that implements flat structure and connection-based discovery principles. It provides atomic, independent pipeline implementations with enhanced metadata integration and sophisticated discovery mechanisms.

## Architecture

The catalog follows a three-tier structure based on Zettelkasten knowledge management principles:

### 1. Atomic Pipeline Organization
- **Flat Structure**: All pipelines stored in simple directories without deep hierarchies
- **Semantic Naming**: Self-documenting filenames following `{framework}_{purpose}_{complexity}` pattern
- **Independence**: Each pipeline is fully self-contained and can run standalone
- **Single Responsibility**: Each pipeline focuses on one coherent workflow concept

### 2. Connection-Based Discovery
- **Connection Registry**: JSON-based registry mapping relationships between pipelines
- **Multiple Relationship Types**: alternatives, related, used_in connections
- **Bidirectional Linking**: Discovery from multiple entry points
- **Curated Connections**: Human-authored relationships capture semantic meaning

### 3. Enhanced Metadata Integration
- **DAGMetadata Integration**: Type-safe metadata through existing DAGMetadata system
- **MODS Compatibility**: Enhanced metadata for MODS-compatible pipelines
- **Tag-Based Classification**: Multi-dimensional tagging for flexible organization
- **Registry Synchronization**: Automatic sync between pipeline metadata and registry

## Key Components

### Core Modules

- **`__init__.py`**: Main entry point with unified API
- **`utils.py`**: Main utilities module with PipelineCatalogManager
- **`catalog_index.json`**: Connection registry and metadata store

### Pipeline Collections

- **`pipelines/`**: Standard atomic pipelines
- **`mods_pipelines/`**: MODS-compatible atomic pipelines  
- **`shared_dags/`**: Reusable DAG components and metadata utilities

### Utility Modules

- **`utils/`**: Specialized utility classes for catalog operations
  - `catalog_registry.py`: Registry management
  - `connection_traverser.py`: Connection navigation
  - `tag_discovery.py`: Tag-based search
  - `recommendation_engine.py`: Pipeline recommendations
  - `registry_validator.py`: Registry validation

## Key Features

### 1. Zettelkasten Principles Applied

**Atomicity**: Each pipeline represents one atomic workflow concept with clear boundaries and interfaces.

**Connectivity**: Explicit connections replace hierarchical positioning, enabling discovery through relationship traversal.

**Anti-Categories**: Flat structure eliminates rigid framework hierarchies, using tag-based classification instead.

**Manual Linking**: Curated connections between related pipelines provide structured navigation paths.

**Dual-Form Structure**: Separation between organizational metadata (outer form) and pipeline implementation (inner form).

### 2. Discovery Mechanisms

- **Framework-based**: Find pipelines by ML framework (XGBoost, PyTorch, etc.)
- **Task-based**: Discover by purpose (training, evaluation, preprocessing, etc.)
- **Complexity-based**: Filter by sophistication level (simple, standard, comprehensive)
- **Tag-based**: Multi-dimensional search using framework, task, domain, and pattern tags
- **Connection-based**: Navigate through alternative, related, and composition relationships
- **Use-case driven**: Get recommendations based on specific ML use cases

### 3. MODS Integration

- **Enhanced Metadata**: MODS-compatible pipelines include additional operational metadata
- **Template Decoration**: Automatic MODS template decoration for enhanced tracking
- **Registry Integration**: MODS metadata automatically synced to connection registry
- **Operational Capabilities**: Support for MODS dashboard integration and governance features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Discovery

```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog import discover_pipelines, load_pipeline

# Discover XGBoost pipelines
xgb_pipelines = discover_pipelines(framework="xgboost")

# Load a specific pipeline
pipeline_func = load_pipeline("xgb_training_simple")
```

### Advanced Discovery with Manager

```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import PipelineCatalogManager

manager = PipelineCatalogManager()

# Get recommendations for a use case
recommendations = manager.get_recommendations("tabular_classification")

# Find alternative approaches
alternatives = manager.get_pipeline_connections("xgb_training_simple")["alternatives"]

# Navigate connection paths
path = manager.find_path("data_preprocessing", "model_evaluation")
```

### Registry Operations

```python
# Validate registry integrity
validation_report = manager.validate_registry()

# Get catalog statistics
stats = manager.get_registry_stats()

# Sync pipeline metadata
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.shared_dags import EnhancedDAGMetadata
success = manager.sync_pipeline(metadata, "my_pipeline.py")
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reduced Complexity
- **60% reduction** in navigation complexity (from 5-level to 2-level depth)
- Simplified mental model for users
- Easier maintenance and updates

### 2. Enhanced Discoverability
- Multiple access paths through different criteria
- Connection-based navigation for exploring relationships
- Tag-based filtering for precise searches
- Use-case-driven recommendations

### 3. Improved Maintainability
- Atomic organization with clear boundaries
- Independent versioning and updates
- Explicit relationship documentation
- Automated validation capabilities

### 4. Scalable Growth
- Organic expansion without structural changes
- Framework-agnostic foundation
- Extensible metadata schema
- Tool-friendly structure

## Migration from Legacy Structure

The catalog was refactored from a deep hierarchical structure (5 levels) to the current flat, connection-based organization. See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for details on:

- Mapping from old paths to new semantic names
- Updated import statements
- Connection registry population
- Validation procedures

## Integration Points

- Operational capabilities and dashboard integration
- Compliance and governance features
- GitFarm integration for version control

### 2. With DAG Compiler
- Enhanced DAGMetadata integration
- Type-safe metadata validation
- Automatic registry synchronization
- Template lifecycle management

### 3. With Validation Framework
- Pipeline validation through registry
- Connection consistency checking
- Metadata completeness verification
- Automated quality assurance

## Performance Characteristics

- **Sub-second discovery** for 100+ pipelines
- **Efficient connection traversal** through optimized graph algorithms
- **Minimal memory footprint** with lazy loading
- **Cached operations** for repeated queries

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Discovery

## Conclusion

The Pipeline Catalog represents a practical application of Zettelkasten knowledge management principles to software organization. By implementing atomicity, connectivity, and emergent organization, it creates a discoverable, maintainable, and scalable foundation for pipeline management that grows naturally with the system's evolution.
