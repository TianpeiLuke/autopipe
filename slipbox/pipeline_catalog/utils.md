# Pipeline Catalog Main Utilities

## Overview

The `utils.py` module serves as the main entry point for pipeline catalog utilities, providing a unified interface for all Zettelkasten-inspired functionality including pipeline discovery, navigation, and management operations.

## Core Components

### PipelineCatalogManager

The main manager class that provides a unified interface for all pipeline catalog functionality, following Zettelkasten knowledge management principles.

#### Key Features

- **Unified API**: Single interface for all catalog operations
- **Component Integration**: Orchestrates all specialized utility classes
- **Registry Management**: Handles catalog registry operations
- **Discovery Coordination**: Coordinates multiple discovery mechanisms
- **Validation Integration**: Provides registry validation capabilities

#### Initialization

```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import PipelineCatalogManager

# Use default registry location
manager = PipelineCatalogManager()

# Use custom registry path
manager = PipelineCatalogManager(registry_path="/path/to/catalog_index.json")
```

#### Core Methods

##### Pipeline Discovery

```python
# Discover by framework
xgb_pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines(framework="xgboost")

# Discover by complexity
simple_pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines(complexity="simple")

# Discover by tags
training_pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines(tags=["training", "supervised_learning"])

# Discover by use case
classification_pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines(use_case="tabular_classification")

# Get all pipelines
all_pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines()
```

##### Connection Navigation

```python
# Get all connections for a pipeline
connections = manager.get_pipeline_connections("xgb_training_simple")
# Returns: {"alternatives": [...], "related": [...], "used_in": [...]}

# Find path between pipelines
path = manager.find_path("data_preprocessing", "model_evaluation")
# Returns: ["data_preprocessing", "xgb_training_simple", "model_evaluation"]
```

##### Recommendations

```python
# Get recommendations for a use case
recommendations = manager.get_recommendations("tabular_classification")
# Returns: [{"pipeline_id": "...", "score": 0.95, "reasons": [...]}, ...]

# Get recommendations with additional criteria
recommendations = manager.get_recommendations(
    "tabular_classification",
    framework="xgboost",
    complexity="simple"
)
```

##### Registry Operations

```python
# Validate registry integrity
validation_report = manager.validate_registry()
# Returns: {"is_valid": True, "issues": [], "statistics": {...}}

# Sync pipeline metadata
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.shared_dags import EnhancedDAGMetadata
success = manager.sync_pipeline(metadata, "my_pipeline.py")

# Get registry statistics
stats = manager.get_registry_stats()
```

### Component Architecture

The manager integrates several specialized components:

#### 1. CatalogRegistry
- **Purpose**: Registry file management and data access
- **Responsibilities**: Load/save registry, provide data access methods
- **Integration**: Core data layer for all operations

#### 2. ConnectionTraverser
- **Purpose**: Navigate connections between pipelines
- **Responsibilities**: Path finding, relationship traversal, connection analysis
- **Integration**: Powers connection-based discovery and navigation

#### 3. TagBasedDiscovery
- **Purpose**: Tag-based search and filtering
- **Responsibilities**: Multi-dimensional tag search, framework/complexity filtering
- **Integration**: Enables flexible discovery mechanisms

#### 4. PipelineRecommendationEngine
- **Purpose**: Intelligent pipeline recommendations
- **Responsibilities**: Use-case matching, scoring algorithms, recommendation ranking
- **Integration**: Combines discovery and traversal for smart suggestions

#### 5. RegistryValidator
- **Purpose**: Registry integrity validation
- **Responsibilities**: Schema validation, consistency checking, issue reporting
- **Integration**: Ensures registry quality and reliability

#### 6. DAGMetadataRegistrySync
- **Purpose**: Synchronization between DAG metadata and registry
- **Responsibilities**: Metadata extraction, registry updates, statistics tracking
- **Integration**: Bridges pipeline implementation and catalog organization

## Convenience Functions

The module provides several convenience functions for direct access to common operations:

### create_catalog_manager()

```python
def create_catalog_manager(registry_path: Optional[str] = None) -> PipelineCatalogManager
```

Creates a new pipeline catalog manager instance with optional custom registry path.

### discover_by_framework()

```python
def discover_by_framework(framework: str, registry_path: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]
```

Quick discovery by framework without creating a manager instance.

**Example:**
```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import discover_by_framework

xgb_pipelines = discover_by_framework("xgboost")
```

### discover_by_tags()

```python
def discover_by_tags(tags: List[str], registry_path: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]
```

Quick discovery by tags without creating a manager instance.

**Example:**
```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import discover_by_tags

training_pipelines = discover_by_tags(["training", "supervised_learning"])
```

### get_pipeline_alternatives()

```python
def get_pipeline_alternatives(pipeline_id: str, registry_path: Optional[str] = None) -> List[str]
```

Get alternative pipelines for a given pipeline without creating a manager instance.

**Example:**
```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import get_pipeline_alternatives

alternatives = get_pipeline_alternatives("xgb_training_simple")
```

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Discovery Pattern

```python
from cursus.pipeline_catalog.utils import PipelineCatalogManager

manager = PipelineCatalogManager()

# Discover pipelines by criteria
pipelines = manager.discover_pipelines(framework="xgboost", complexity="simple")

# Load and use pipeline
from cursus.pipeline_catalog import load_pipeline
pipeline_func = load_pipeline(pipelines[0])
```

### Connection Navigation Pattern

```python
# Start with a known pipeline
start_pipeline = "xgb_training_simple"

# Explore alternatives
connections = manager.get_pipeline_connections(start_pipeline)
alternatives = connections["alternatives"]

# Find related pipelines
related = connections["related"]

# Explore composition opportunities
used_in = connections["used_in"]
```

### Recommendation-Driven Pattern

```python
# Get recommendations for a specific use case
recommendations = manager.get_recommendations("tabular_classification")

# Select top recommendation
best_pipeline = recommendations[0]["pipeline_id"]

# Explore alternatives to the recommendation
alternatives = manager.get_pipeline_connections(best_pipeline)["alternatives"]
```

### Validation and Maintenance Pattern

```python
# Validate registry integrity
report = manager.validate_registry()

if not report["is_valid"]:
    print("Registry issues found:")
    for issue in report["issues"]:
        print(f"- {issue}")

# Get registry statistics
stats = manager.get_registry_stats()
print(f"Total pipelines: {stats['total_pipelines']}")
print(f"Total connections: {stats['total_connections']}")
```

## Integration with Zettelkasten Principles

### 1. Atomicity Support
- Each manager operation focuses on a single, well-defined task
- Clear separation of concerns between different utility components
- Independent operation capabilities without complex dependencies

### 2. Connectivity Enhancement
- Connection traversal enables discovery through relationship navigation
- Path finding supports multi-hop pipeline composition
- Bidirectional relationship support for comprehensive exploration

### 3. Anti-Categories Implementation
- Tag-based discovery replaces rigid hierarchical navigation
- Multiple discovery dimensions (framework, complexity, use-case, tags)
- Emergent organization through connection patterns

### 4. Manual Linking Support
- Curated connections maintained through registry operations
- Human-authored relationship annotations preserved and utilized
- Connection validation ensures link quality and consistency

### 5. Dual-Form Structure
- Clear separation between organizational operations (manager) and implementation (pipelines)
- Metadata management separate from functional pipeline code
- Registry as organizational layer, pipelines as implementation layer

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Registry data cached after first load
- Connection graph cached for efficient traversal
- Tag indexes maintained for fast discovery

### Lazy Loading
- Components initialized only when needed
- Registry loaded on first access
- Expensive operations deferred until required

### Memory Management
- Minimal memory footprint for manager instance
- Efficient data structures for connection storage
- Garbage collection friendly object lifecycle

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Operations continue with partial data when possible
- Fallback mechanisms for missing registry data
- Default values for incomplete metadata

### Validation Integration
- Automatic validation during critical operations
- Clear error messages for common issues
- Recovery suggestions for validation failures

### Exception Management
- Specific exceptions for different error types
- Comprehensive error context in exception messages
- Logging integration for debugging support

## Testing Support

### Mock-Friendly Design
- Dependency injection for all components
- Interface-based component interaction
- Testable methods with clear inputs/outputs

### Validation Utilities
- Built-in validation for testing registry integrity
- Statistics generation for test verification
- Component isolation for unit testing

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Discovery
- Machine learning-based recommendations
- Usage pattern analysis for improved suggestions
- Collaborative filtering for community-driven recommendations

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel discovery operations
- Advanced caching strategies
- Query optimization for large catalogs

### Integration Expansion
- External catalog federation
- Plugin system for custom discovery mechanisms
- API endpoints for remote catalog access
