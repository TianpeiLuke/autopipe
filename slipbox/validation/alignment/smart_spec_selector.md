# Smart Specification Selector

## Overview

The `SmartSpecificationSelector` class implements the Smart Specification Selection logic for handling multi-variant specifications in the alignment validation framework. This component addresses the challenge of validating contracts against multiple specification variants (training, testing, validation, calibration) by creating unified specification models and implementing intelligent validation logic.

## Core Functionality

### Multi-Variant Specification Handling

The Smart Specification Selector provides sophisticated logic for:

1. **Variant Detection**: Automatically categorizes specifications by job type (training, testing, validation, calibration, generic)
2. **Unified Model Creation**: Creates union of all dependencies and outputs from multiple variants
3. **Metadata Tracking**: Maintains information about which variants contribute specific dependencies/outputs
4. **Primary Selection**: Intelligently selects primary specifications for validation

### Key Components

#### SmartSpecificationSelector Class

The main class that orchestrates multi-variant specification handling:

```python
class SmartSpecificationSelector:
    """
    Handles Smart Specification Selection logic for multi-variant specifications.
    
    This implements the core logic for:
    1. Detecting specification variants (training, testing, validation, calibration)
    2. Creating a union of all dependencies and outputs
    3. Providing metadata about which variants contribute what
    4. Selecting primary specifications for validation
    """
```

## Core Methods

### create_unified_specification()

Creates a unified specification model from multiple specification variants:

**Purpose**: Implements Smart Specification Selection by detecting variants, creating unions, and providing metadata

**Process**:
1. Groups specifications by job type (training, testing, validation, calibration, generic)
2. Creates unified dependency and output sets from all variants
3. Tracks which variants contribute each dependency/output
4. Selects primary specification using priority logic

**Returns**: Unified specification model containing:
- `primary_spec`: Selected primary specification
- `variants`: Dictionary of all specification variants
- `unified_dependencies`: Union of all dependencies
- `unified_outputs`: Union of all outputs
- `dependency_sources`: Mapping of dependencies to contributing variants
- `output_sources`: Mapping of outputs to contributing variants
- `variant_count`: Total number of variants

### validate_logical_names_smart()

Implements smart validation of logical names using multi-variant specification logic:

**Smart Validation Rules**:
1. **Contract Input Validation**: Contract input is valid if it exists in ANY variant
2. **Required Dependencies**: Contract must cover intersection of REQUIRED dependencies
3. **Variant-Specific Feedback**: Provides detailed information about which variants need what
4. **Multi-Variant Summary**: Reports validation results across all variants

**Validation Categories**:
- **ERROR**: Invalid inputs/outputs not in any variant, missing required dependencies
- **WARNING**: Missing outputs that some variants produce
- **INFO**: Valid optional inputs, multi-variant validation summaries

### _select_primary_specification()

Selects the primary specification from available variants using priority logic:

**Priority Order**:
1. `training` - Most common and comprehensive variant
2. `generic` - Applies to all job types
3. First available variant - Fallback option

### _extract_job_type_from_spec_name()

Extracts job type from specification name using pattern matching:

**Supported Job Types**:
- `training` - Training job specifications
- `testing` - Testing job specifications  
- `validation` - Validation job specifications
- `calibration` - Calibration job specifications
- `generic` - Generic/default specifications

## Smart Validation Logic

### Multi-Variant Validation Strategy

The Smart Specification Selector implements sophisticated validation logic that handles the complexity of multiple specification variants:

#### Input Validation
- **Union Logic**: Contract inputs are valid if they exist in ANY specification variant
- **Required Dependencies**: Contract must provide all dependencies marked as required across variants
- **Optional Dependencies**: Contract can provide optional dependencies from any variant

#### Output Validation
- **Completeness Check**: Validates contract outputs against unified output set
- **Variant Tracking**: Reports which variants produce specific outputs
- **Missing Output Warnings**: Identifies outputs that contract doesn't declare

#### Feedback System
- **Variant-Specific Messages**: Indicates which variants require/produce specific logical names
- **Multi-Variant Summary**: Provides overview of validation across all variants
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggests specific fixes for validation issues

## Integration Points

### Alignment Validation Framework
- Integrates with Level 2 Contractâ†”Specification alignment validation
- Provides enhanced logical name validation for multi-variant scenarios
- Supports the unified alignment tester architecture

### Specification Loading System
- Works with specification loaders to handle multiple specification files
- Processes specification variants from different job type configurations
- Maintains compatibility with single-specification validation

### Validation Reporting
- Generates detailed validation reports with variant-specific information
- Provides severity-based issue categorization (ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
- Includes actionable recommendations for resolving validation issues

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Multi-Variant Validation

```python
selector = SmartSpecificationSelector()

# Create unified specification from variants
unified_spec = selector.create_unified_specification(
    specifications=loaded_specs,
    contract_name="my_contract"
)

# Perform smart validation
issues = selector.validate_logical_names_smart(
    contract=contract_data,
    unified_spec=unified_spec,
    contract_name="my_contract"
)
```

### Variant Analysis

```python
# Analyze specification variants
unified_spec = selector.create_unified_specification(specifications, contract_name)

print(f"Found {unified_spec['variant_count']} variants:")
for variant_name in unified_spec['variants'].keys():
    print(f"  - {variant_name}")

print(f"Unified dependencies: {len(unified_spec['unified_dependencies'])}")
print(f"Unified outputs: {len(unified_spec['unified_outputs'])}")
```
