# Dependency Validator

## Overview

The `DependencyValidator` class handles comprehensive validation of dependencies between step specifications, implementing Level 3 (Specification ↔ Dependencies) alignment validation. This component provides enhanced dependency resolution with compatibility scoring, circular dependency detection, and data type consistency validation, integrating with the production registry for canonical name mapping.

## Core Functionality

### Advanced Dependency Validation Features

The Dependency Validator provides sophisticated validation capabilities:

1. **Enhanced Dependency Resolution**: Compatibility scoring with configurable thresholds
2. **Circular Dependency Detection**: Graph-based cycle detection in dependency chains
3. **Data Type Consistency**: Validation of type alignment across dependency relationships
4. **Registry Integration**: Canonical name mapping using production step registry
5. **Configurable Validation**: Flexible threshold management via Level3ValidationConfig

### Key Components

#### DependencyValidator Class

The main validator class that orchestrates all dependency validation operations:

```python
class DependencyValidator:
    """
    Validates dependencies between step specifications.
    
    Features:
    - Enhanced dependency resolution with compatibility scoring
    - Circular dependency detection
    - Data type consistency validation
    - Integration with production registry for canonical name mapping
    """
```

## Core Methods

### Enhanced Dependency Resolution

#### validate_dependency_resolution()

Performs enhanced dependency validation with compatibility scoring:

**Purpose**: Validates that all dependencies can be resolved with acceptable compatibility scores

**Process**:
1. Populates resolver registry with all available specifications
2. Converts specification names to canonical names using production registry
3. Performs enhanced resolution with compatibility scoring
4. Processes resolved and failed dependencies with detailed feedback
5. Generates validation issues based on configurable thresholds

**Validation Logic**:
- **Resolved Dependencies**: Logged for transparency and debugging
- **Failed Dependencies**: Analyzed with compatibility scoring
- **No Candidates**: Critical issues for required dependencies
- **Low Compatibility**: Issues based on threshold configuration

**Integration Features**:
- Uses `Level3ValidationConfig` for threshold management
- Integrates with production dependency resolver
- Provides detailed score breakdowns and alternative candidates

#### validate_circular_dependencies()

Validates that no circular dependencies exist in the specification graph:

**Algorithm**: Depth-First Search (DFS) with recursion stack tracking

**Process**:
1. Builds dependency graph from all specifications
2. Maps logical names to producer specifications
3. Performs cycle detection using DFS traversal
4. Reports circular dependencies as validation errors

**Graph Construction**:
- Nodes: Specification names
- Edges: Dependency relationships (consumer → producer)
- Cycle Detection: Recursion stack tracking during DFS

#### validate_dependency_data_types()

Validates data type consistency across dependency chains:

**Purpose**: Ensures type compatibility between dependency consumers and producers

**Validation Process**:
1. Extracts expected data types from dependency specifications
2. Finds producer specifications for each logical name
3. Compares expected vs. actual data types
4. Reports type mismatches as warnings

**Type Consistency Rules**:
- Exact type matching required for full compatibility
- Type mismatches generate warnings with specific recommendations
- Missing type information handled gracefully

### Registry Integration

#### _get_available_canonical_step_names()

Gets available canonical step names using the registry as single source of truth:

**Purpose**: Ensures alignment with production dependency resolution

**Process**:
1. Queries production registry for authoritative canonical names
2. Returns complete list of available step names
3. Provides logging for debugging and transparency

#### _get_canonical_step_name()

Converts specification file names to canonical step names:

**Mapping Strategy**:
1. **Primary**: Uses centralized registry mapping (FILE_NAME_TO_CANONICAL)
2. **Fallback**: Converts file name to spec_type format
3. **Ultimate Fallback**: Returns base spec_type without job type suffix

**Job Type Handling**:
- Recognizes job type suffixes: training, validation, testing, calibration
- Strips job types for canonical name resolution
- Maintains job type context for validation

#### _populate_resolver_registry()

Populates the dependency resolver registry with canonical specifications:

**Process**:
1. Converts file-based spec names to canonical names
2. Converts specification dictionaries to StepSpecification objects
3. Registers specifications with canonical names in resolver
4. Provides comprehensive error handling and logging

### Reporting and Analysis

#### get_dependency_resolution_report()

Generates detailed dependency resolution report:

**Report Contents**:
- Complete resolution analysis for all specifications
- Compatibility scores and breakdowns
- Alternative candidate information
- Resolution statistics and summaries

#### _generate_compatibility_recommendation()

Generates specific recommendations based on compatibility analysis:

**Recommendation Categories**:
- **Type Compatibility**: Data type alignment suggestions
- **Semantic Similarity**: Naming and alias recommendations
- **Source Compatibility**: Compatible source configuration
- **Data Type Compatibility**: Type specification alignment

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Dependency Validation

```python
# Create validator with configuration
config = Level3ValidationConfig.create_relaxed_config()
validator = DependencyValidator(config)

# Validate dependencies for a specification
issues = validator.validate_dependency_resolution(
    specification=spec_dict,
    all_specs=all_specifications,
    spec_name="training_specification"
)

# Process validation results
for issue in issues:
    print(f"{issue['severity']}: {issue['message']}")
```

### Comprehensive Validation Suite

```python
validator = DependencyValidator()

# Run all validation types
resolution_issues = validator.validate_dependency_resolution(spec, all_specs, spec_name)
circular_issues = validator.validate_circular_dependencies(spec, all_specs, spec_name)
type_issues = validator.validate_dependency_data_types(spec, all_specs, spec_name)

# Combine all issues
all_issues = resolution_issues + circular_issues + type_issues

# Generate detailed report
report = validator.get_dependency_resolution_report(all_specs)
```

### Configuration-Based Validation

```python
# Strict validation for production
strict_config = Level3ValidationConfig.create_strict_config()
strict_validator = DependencyValidator(strict_config)

# Permissive validation for development
permissive_config = Level3ValidationConfig.create_permissive_config()
dev_validator = DependencyValidator(permissive_config)

# Custom threshold validation
custom_config = Level3ValidationConfig.create_custom_config(
    pass_threshold=0.7,
    warning_threshold=0.5,
    error_threshold=0.3
)
custom_validator = DependencyValidator(custom_config)
```
