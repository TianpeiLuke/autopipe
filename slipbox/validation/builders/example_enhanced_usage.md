# Enhanced Universal Step Builder Test Usage Examples

## Overview

The `example_enhanced_usage.py` module provides comprehensive demonstration of the enhanced UniversalStepBuilderTest framework with integrated scoring and reporting capabilities. This example script showcases the new features while maintaining backward compatibility with existing test infrastructure.

## Purpose

This demonstration module serves multiple purposes:

1. **Feature Showcase**: Demonstrates all enhanced testing capabilities including scoring, structured reporting, and JSON export
2. **Usage Patterns**: Provides concrete examples of different ways to use the enhanced testing framework
3. **Migration Guide**: Shows how existing code can be upgraded to use new features while maintaining compatibility
4. **Best Practices**: Illustrates recommended approaches for different testing scenarios

## Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Enhanced Testing with Scoring

The enhanced framework provides quantitative quality assessment through integrated scoring:

```python
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(
    TabularPreprocessingStepBuilder, 
    verbose=True,
    enable_scoring=True
)

results = tester.run_all_tests()
overall_score = results['scoring']['overall']['score']  # 0-100 scale
rating = results['scoring']['overall']['rating']        # Qualitative rating
```

**Benefits:**
- Quantitative quality metrics (0-100 scale)
- Qualitative ratings (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
- Detailed scoring breakdown by test category
- Trend analysis capabilities

### 2. Structured Reporting

The framework generates comprehensive structured reports for detailed analysis:

```python
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(
    BuilderClass,
    enable_scoring=True,
    enable_structured_reporting=True
)

results = tester.run_all_tests()
structured_report = results['structured_report']
```

**Report Sections:**
- **Builder Info**: Class details, step type, inheritance hierarchy
- **Summary**: Pass rates, test counts, overall scores
- **Test Results**: Detailed results by category
- **Scoring Details**: Breakdown of quality metrics
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### 3. Multiple Output Formats

The enhanced system supports various output formats for different use cases:

#### Raw Results (Legacy Compatible)
```python
raw_results = tester.run_all_tests_legacy()
# Returns original dict format for backward compatibility
```

#### Scored Results
```python
scored_results = tester.run_all_tests_with_scoring()
# Includes test results + scoring data
```

#### Full Report
```python
full_results = tester.run_all_tests_with_full_report()
# Complete package: tests + scoring + structured report
```

#### JSON Export
```python
json_content = tester.export_results_to_json("report.json")
# Exports complete results to JSON file
```

## Demonstration Functions

### `demonstrate_enhanced_testing()`

The main demonstration function showcases four key usage scenarios:

1. **Basic Testing with Scoring**: Shows default enhanced behavior with quantitative metrics
2. **Full Reporting**: Demonstrates comprehensive structured output generation
3. **Convenience Methods**: Illustrates different ways to access specific result types
4. **JSON Export**: Shows how to export results for external analysis

### `show_usage_patterns()`

Provides a reference guide for different usage patterns:

- **Legacy Compatible**: Maintains original behavior for existing code
- **Enhanced with Scoring**: Adds quantitative assessment to existing tests
- **Full Reporting**: Generates comprehensive analysis reports
- **Convenient Methods**: Simplified access to specific result types

## Integration Points

### With Universal Test Framework

The enhanced usage examples integrate seamlessly with the core universal testing infrastructure:

```python
from .universal_test import UniversalStepBuilderTest
```

**Key Integration Features:**
- Backward compatibility with existing test suites
- Consistent API with enhanced capabilities
- Configurable feature enablement
- Flexible output format selection

### With Step Builders

Examples demonstrate testing of actual step builder implementations:

```python
from ...steps.builders.builder_tabular_preprocessing_step import TabularPreprocessingStepBuilder
```

**Testing Capabilities:**
- Interface validation
- Specification compliance
- Integration testing
- Quality scoring

### With Scoring System

The examples showcase integration with the scoring and rating system:

- **Quantitative Metrics**: 0-100 scoring scale
- **Qualitative Ratings**: Human-readable quality assessments
- **Category Breakdown**: Detailed scoring by test type
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical quality tracking

## Usage Scenarios

### Development Testing

For active development and debugging:

```python
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(BuilderClass, verbose=True)
results = tester.run_all_tests()
print(f"Quality Score: {results['scoring']['overall']['score']:.1f}/100")
```

### CI/CD Integration

For automated testing pipelines:

```python
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(BuilderClass, verbose=False)
results = tester.run_all_tests()
json_report = tester.export_results_to_json("ci_report.json")
```

### Quality Analysis

For comprehensive quality assessment:

```python
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(
    BuilderClass,
    enable_scoring=True,
    enable_structured_reporting=True
)
full_results = tester.run_all_tests()
```

### Legacy Migration

For upgrading existing test code:

```python
# Old code (still works)
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(BuilderClass, enable_scoring=False)
results = tester.run_all_tests()

# Enhanced version
tester = UniversalStepBuilderTest(BuilderClass)  # scoring enabled by default
results = tester.run_all_tests()
score = results['scoring']['overall']['score']
```

## Error Handling

The demonstration includes robust error handling for common scenarios:

### Import Errors
- Graceful handling when step builders are not available
- Clear error messages for missing dependencies
- Environment-specific guidance

### Runtime Errors
- Exception catching with detailed traceback
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
- User-friendly error reporting
