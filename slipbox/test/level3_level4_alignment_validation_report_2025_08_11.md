# Level 3 & Level 4 Alignment Validation Report
**Date:** August 11, 2025  
**Focus:** Specification ↔ Dependencies (Level 3) and Builder ↔ Configuration (Level 4)

## Executive Summary

After successfully renaming the MIMS contracts from `mims_payload_contract.py` → `payload_contract.py` and `mims_package_contract.py` → `package_contract.py`, the comprehensive alignment validation shows significant improvements in Level 1 and Level 2 alignment. However, Level 3 and Level 4 issues persist across all scripts.

## Contract Renaming Success ✅

The contract renaming operation was completed successfully:

### Files Renamed:
- `src/cursus/steps/contracts/mims_payload_contract.py` → `src/cursus/steps/contracts/payload_contract.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/contracts/mims_package_contract.py` → `src/cursus/steps/contracts/package_contract.py`

### Constants Renamed:
- `MIMS_PAYLOAD_CONTRACT` → `PAYLOAD_CONTRACT`
- `MIMS_PACKAGE_CONTRACT` → `PACKAGE_CONTRACT`

### Updated References:
- `src/cursus/steps/specs/payload_spec.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/specs/packaging_spec.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/configs/config_payload_step.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/configs/config_package_step.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/contracts/__init__.py`
- `src/cursus/steps/contracts/contract_validator.py`

## Level 3 Analysis: Specification ↔ Dependencies

### ✅ PASSING Scripts (5/8):
1. **currency_conversion** - All dependencies resolved successfully
2. **model_calibration** - All dependencies resolved successfully  
3. **risk_table_mapping** - All dependencies resolved successfully
4. **package** - ⚠️ Status shows PASS but has 1 issue (needs investigation)
5. **tabular_preprocessing** - ⚠️ Status shows PASS but has 1 issue (needs investigation)

### ❌ FAILING Scripts (3/8):

#### 1. dummy_training
- **Issue:** Could not resolve required dependency: `Dummy.hyperparameters_s3_uri`
- **Impact:** Missing hyperparameters dependency prevents proper training step execution
- **Recommendation:** Add hyperparameters specification or mark as optional

#### 2. payload  
- **Issue:** Could not resolve required dependency: `Payload.model_input`
- **Impact:** Payload generation cannot find model artifacts to process
- **Recommendation:** Verify model dependency specification and available model outputs

#### 3. xgboost_model_evaluation
- **Issues:** 
  - No specification found for step: `XgboostModelEvaluation`
  - Multiple dependency resolution failures
- **Impact:** Model evaluation step cannot be properly integrated
- **Recommendation:** Create proper specification for XgboostModelEvaluation step

### Key Level 3 Insights:

1. **Dependency Resolution Working:** The dependency resolver successfully matches most dependencies using semantic keywords and aliases
2. **Model Dependencies:** Several scripts struggle with model artifact dependencies, suggesting need for better model output specifications
3. **Hyperparameters:** Multiple scripts missing hyperparameters dependencies

## Level 4 Analysis: Builder ↔ Configuration

### ❌ ALL Scripts FAILING (8/8):

Every script shows Level 4 failures, indicating systematic issues with builder-configuration alignment:

1. **currency_conversion** - 1 issue
2. **dummy_training** - 1 issue  
3. **model_calibration** - 1 issue
4. **package** - 1 issue
5. **payload** - 1 issue
6. **risk_table_mapping** - 1 issue
7. **tabular_preprocessing** - 1 issue
8. **xgboost_model_evaluation** - 1 issue

### Common Level 4 Issues:

Based on the pattern, likely issues include:
- **Missing Builders:** Some scripts may not have corresponding step builders
- **Configuration Mismatches:** Builder configurations may not align with script contracts
- **Registration Issues:** Builders may not be properly registered in the builder registry
- **Interface Mismatches:** Builder interfaces may not match expected configuration patterns

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Level 3):

1. **Fix payload model dependency:**
   ```bash
   # Investigate payload specification model_input dependency
   # Ensure model artifacts are properly specified with correct aliases
   ```

2. **Resolve dummy_training hyperparameters:**
   ```bash
   # Add hyperparameters specification or mark as optional in dummy training contract
   ```

3. **Create XgboostModelEvaluation specification:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure proper specification exists for xgboost model evaluation step
   ```

### Systematic Actions (Level 4):

1. **Builder Registry Audit:**
   - Verify all scripts have corresponding builders
   - Check builder registration in `src/cursus/steps/builders/__init__.py`
   - Ensure builder names follow naming conventions

2. **Configuration Alignment:**
   - Verify builder configurations match script contracts
   - Check configuration field mappings
   - Ensure proper inheritance from base configuration classes

3. **Interface Validation:**
   - Verify builder interfaces match expected patterns
   - Check method signatures and return types
   - Ensure proper integration with step creation workflow

## Success Metrics

### Level 3 Target: 7/8 scripts passing
- **Current:** 5/8 passing (62.5%)
- **Target:** 7/8 passing (87.5%)
- **Gap:** 2 scripts need dependency fixes

### Level 4 Target: 6/8 scripts passing  
- **Current:** 0/8 passing (0%)
- **Target:** 6/8 passing (75%)
- **Gap:** Systematic builder-configuration alignment needed

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Level 4 Issues:** Run detailed builder validation to identify specific configuration mismatches
2. **Fix Model Dependencies:** Resolve payload and dummy_training dependency issues
3. **Complete XGBoost Specification:** Create missing XgboostModelEvaluation specification
4. **Builder Registry Review:** Ensure all builders are properly registered and configured
5. **Integration Testing:** Test end-to-end pipeline creation with fixed components

## Conclusion

The contract renaming operation was successful and resolved the Level 2 import issues. Level 3 shows good progress with 5/8 scripts passing dependency resolution. Level 4 requires systematic attention to builder-configuration alignment across all scripts. The foundation is solid, and targeted fixes should bring both levels to acceptable passing rates.
