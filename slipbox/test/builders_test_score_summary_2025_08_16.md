## Key Issues and Recommendations

### 1. âœ… PyTorchTraining Spec-Contract Alignment - RESOLVED
**Previous Issue**: Contract outputs missing from specification outputs: `{'checkpoints'}`
**Resolution Applied**: 
- Removed incorrect `checkpoints` output from contract (internal training mechanics, not pipeline outputs)
- Updated specification data_output property path to match XGBoost patterns
- Added comprehensive aliases for data output
**Result**: Perfect 100% score achieved (up from 82.3%)

### 2. âœ… CreateModel Step Configuration - RESOLVED
**Previous Issues**: Mock configuration and parameter handling issues
**Impact**: Both builders were at 82.8% instead of potential 100%
**Resolutions Applied**:
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Enhanced mock_extractall function to handle filter parameter for newer Python versions
- **API Alignment**: Fixed CreateModelStep constructor to use model parameter instead of step_args
- **Result**: Perfect 100% scores achieved for both builders (up from 82.8%)
