- Updated specification data_output property path to match XGBoost patterns
- Added comprehensive aliases for data output
**Result**: Perfect 100% score achieved (up from 82.3%)

### 2. CreateModel Step Configuration
**Issue**: Mock configuration and parameter handling issues
**Impact**: Both builders at 82.8% instead of potential 100%
**Priority**: Medium

**Potential Enhancements**:
- Performance testing for step creation time
- Resource validation (compute configurations)
- Security testing (IAM roles, permissions)
- Integration testing with actual SageMaker services
