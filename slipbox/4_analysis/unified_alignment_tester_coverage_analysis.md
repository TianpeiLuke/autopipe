# Unified Alignment Tester Coverage Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the alignment rules defined in the developer guide (`slipbox/0_developer_guide/alignment_rules.md`) against the implementation in the unified alignment validation tester (`src/cursus/validation/alignment/`). The analysis reveals that while the tester achieves exceptional success rates (87.5% overall), there are **7 critical alignment rules** that are either missing or only partially implemented.

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ **18 alignment rules fully implemented** across all 4 levels
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5 alignment rules partially implemented** with gaps
- ‚ùå **2 alignment rules completely missing** from implementation
- üîÑ **1 cross-level validation rule** not implemented

## Alignment Rules Definition

The developer guide defines **4 main alignment principles** with specific validation requirements:

### 1. Script ‚Üî Contract Alignment (Level 1)
- Scripts must use exactly the paths defined in their Script Contract
- Environment variable names, input/output directory structures, and file patterns must match the contract
- **Argument Naming Convention**: Contract arguments use CLI-style hyphens, scripts use Python-style underscores (standard argparse behavior)
- Path usage validation
- Environment variable access validation
- File operations validation

### 2. Contract ‚Üî Specification Alignment (Level 2)
- Logical names in Script Contract (`expected_input_paths`, `expected_output_paths`) must match dependency names in Step Specification
- Property paths in `OutputSpec` must correspond to the contract's output paths
- Data type consistency validation
- Input/output alignment validation

### 3. Specification ‚Üî Dependencies Alignment (Level 3)
- Dependencies declared in Step Specification must match upstream step outputs by logical name or alias
- `DependencySpec.compatible_sources` must list all steps that produce the required output
- No circular dependencies exist
- Data type consistency across dependency chains

### 4. Builder ‚Üî Configuration Alignment (Level 4)
- Step Builders must pass configuration parameters to SageMaker components according to the config class
- Environment variables set in the builder (`_get_processor_env_vars`) must cover all `required_env_vars` from the contract
- Configuration field handling validation
- Required field validation

## Implementation Coverage Analysis

### ‚úÖ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED RULES**

#### Level 1 (Script ‚Üî Contract) - 100% Success Rate
- ‚úÖ **Path usage validation** with enhanced detection beyond basic file operations
- ‚úÖ **Environment variable access validation** with required/optional distinction
- ‚úÖ **Argument naming convention validation** (CLI hyphens ‚Üî Python underscores)
- ‚úÖ **File operations validation** with enhanced context-aware detection
- ‚úÖ **Contract path mapping validation** using contract-aware logical name resolution
- ‚úÖ **Builder argument integration** to reduce false positives for config-driven arguments

#### Level 2 (Contract ‚Üî Specification) - 100% Success Rate
- ‚úÖ **Logical name matching validation** with Smart Specification Selection
- ‚úÖ **Input/output alignment validation** across multiple specification variants
- ‚úÖ **Multi-variant support architecture** handling training/testing/validation/calibration variants
- ‚úÖ **Data type consistency validation** (basic implementation)
- ‚úÖ **Unified specification model** creating union of all dependencies and outputs

#### Level 3 (Specification ‚Üî Dependencies) - 50% Success Rate
- ‚úÖ **Dependency resolution validation** with production dependency resolver integration
- ‚úÖ **Circular dependency detection** using DFS algorithm
- ‚úÖ **Data type consistency validation** across dependency chains
- ‚úÖ **Compatible sources validation** with confidence scoring
- ‚úÖ **Canonical name mapping** using production registry as single source of truth
- ‚úÖ **Threshold-based validation** with configurable strictness levels

#### Level 4 (Builder ‚Üî Configuration) - 100% Success Rate
- ‚úÖ **Configuration field handling validation** with pattern-aware filtering
- ‚úÖ **Required field validation** with architectural pattern recognition
- ‚úÖ **Configuration import validation** with hybrid file resolution
- ‚úÖ **Default value consistency validation** between builder and specification
- ‚úÖ **Hybrid file resolution system** with three-tier resolution strategy

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED RULES**

#### 1. **SageMaker Component Parameter Validation (Level 4)**
- **Rule**: "Step Builders must pass configuration parameters to SageMaker components according to the config class"
- **Current Implementation**: Validates config field access but doesn't validate parameter passing to SageMaker components
- **Gap**: Missing validation of actual parameter mapping in SageMaker step creation
- **Impact**: Could miss parameter mapping issues in SageMaker step creation
- **Recommendation**: Add SageMaker component parameter mapping validation

#### 2. **Alias Support Validation (Level 3)**
- **Rule**: "Dependencies declared in Step Specification must match upstream step outputs by logical name **or alias**"
- **Current Implementation**: Dependency resolver supports aliases but validation reporting doesn't clearly indicate alias usage
- **Gap**: Unclear feedback about alias-based matches in validation reports
- **Impact**: Could provide unclear feedback about alias-based dependency resolution
- **Recommendation**: Enhance reporting to clearly indicate when alias matching is used

#### 3. **File Pattern Validation (Level 1)**
- **Rule**: "file patterns must match the contract"
- **Current Implementation**: Validates file paths but doesn't validate file patterns (e.g., `*.csv`, `*.json`)
- **Gap**: Missing pattern-based file access validation
- **Impact**: Could miss pattern-based file access issues
- **Recommendation**: Add file pattern matching validation to static analysis

#### 4. **Framework Requirements Validation (Level 1)**
- **Rule**: Implicit in contract structure - `framework_requirements` should be validated
- **Current Implementation**: Loads `framework_requirements` from contracts but doesn't validate them
- **Gap**: No validation of framework requirements against script usage
- **Impact**: Could miss framework version mismatches
- **Recommendation**: Add framework requirements validation against script imports

#### 5. **Data Type Consistency Validation (Level 2)**
- **Rule**: Data type consistency between contract and specification
- **Current Implementation**: Basic implementation with limited validation
- **Gap**: Contract format doesn't include explicit data type declarations
- **Impact**: Limited data type validation capability
- **Recommendation**: Enhance contract format to include data type information

### ‚ùå **COMPLETELY MISSING RULES**

#### 1. **Property Path Validation (Level 2)**
- **Rule**: "Property paths in `OutputSpec` must correspond to the contract's output paths"
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Details**: Level 2 tester validates logical name matching but doesn't validate that the `property_path` in OutputSpec actually corresponds to the contract's output paths
- **Impact**: Could miss misaligned property paths that would cause runtime failures
- **Recommendation**: Implement property path correspondence validation

#### 2. **Environment Variable Coverage Validation (Level 4)**
- **Rule**: "Environment variables set in the builder (`_get_processor_env_vars`) must cover all `required_env_vars` from the contract"
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Details**: Level 4 tester doesn't cross-reference with contract's `required_env_vars`
- **Impact**: Could miss cases where builder doesn't set required environment variables
- **Recommendation**: Implement cross-level validation between Level 4 and Level 1

### üîÑ **CROSS-LEVEL CONSISTENCY VALIDATION**

#### Cross-Level Consistency Validation
- **Rule**: Implicit - consistency across all 4 levels should be validated
- **Status**: ‚ùå **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
- **Details**: Each level validates independently, but there's no cross-level consistency check
- **Impact**: Could miss issues that span multiple levels
- **Examples**:
  - Environment variables required in contract but not set in builder
  - Property paths in specifications that don't align with contract outputs
  - Configuration fields accessed in builder but not declared in contract
- **Recommendation**: Implement cross-level validation orchestrator
