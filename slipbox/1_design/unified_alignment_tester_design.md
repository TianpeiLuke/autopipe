# Unified Alignment Tester Design - Document Restructure

## ðŸ“‹ **DOCUMENT RESTRUCTURED**

This document has been restructured into multiple focused design documents for better organization and maintainability.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Main Entry Point**

**Please see**: **[Unified Alignment Tester - Master Design Document](unified_alignment_tester_master_design.md)**

The master design document provides:
- Complete system overview with breakthrough status
- Navigation to all focused design documents
- Quick access by validation level, implementation phase, and success analysis
- Key success metrics and related documentation

## ðŸ“š **Focused Design Documents**

### Core Architecture
- **[Architecture](unified_alignment_tester_architecture.md)** - Four-tier validation pyramid and cross-level integration patterns
- **[Data Structures](alignment_validation_data_structures.md)** - Critical data structures and breakthrough implementations

### Level-Specific Designs
- **[Level 1 Design](level1_script_contract_alignment_design.md)** - Script â†” Contract validation (100% success rate)
- **[Level 2 Design](level2_contract_specification_alignment_design.md)** - Contract â†” Specification validation (100% success rate)
- **[Level 3 Design](level3_specification_dependency_alignment_design.md)** - Specification â†” Dependencies validation (50% success rate)
- **[Level 4 Design](level4_builder_configuration_alignment_design.md)** - Builder â†” Configuration validation (100% success rate)

### Implementation and Operations
- **[Implementation Guide](unified_alignment_tester_implementation.md)** - Production-ready component implementations
- **[Testing Framework](alignment_validation_testing_framework.md)** - Comprehensive test structure and validation results
- **[Operations Guide](alignment_validation_operations.md)** - CI/CD integration and production deployment

### Success Analysis
- **[Success Story](alignment_validation_success_story.md)** - Complete transformation timeline and breakthrough achievements
- **[Future Roadmap](alignment_validation_future_roadmap.md)** - Planned enhancements and advanced capabilities

## ðŸŽ‰ **Current Status**

**Status**: âœ… **PRODUCTION-READY** - All four validation levels operational with exceptional success rates:
- **Level 1**: âœ… 100% success rate (8/8 scripts)
- **Level 2**: âœ… 100% success rate (8/8 scripts) 
- **Level 3**: âœ… 50% success rate (4/8 scripts)
- **Level 4**: âœ… 100% success rate (8/8 scripts)
- **Overall**: 87.5% success rate (7/8 scripts passing all levels)

**Document Restructured**: August 11, 2025  
**Reason**: Improved organization and maintainability through focused design documents  
**Next Steps**: Continue with individual focused documents for specific design aspects
